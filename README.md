# Scoundrel for Playdate

This is an implementation of [Scoundrel][scoundrel] by Zach Gage and Kurt Bieg
for the [Playdate][playdate]. It largely serves as a basic demonstration of the
engine I used to build [Spilled Mushrooms][spilled-mushrooms], but it's largely
not a thorough or robust example of all the functionality provided by it.

The game does very little in the way of teaching you how to play the game, so I
recommend reading the original ruleset [here][scoundrel].

All code and images are, to the best of my knowledge, produced by me. Sound
effects are made by choosh for Spilled Mushrooms and repurposed here.

This code and all assets are explicitly and intentionally unlicensed.
